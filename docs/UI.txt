Buttons trigger on mouse click xor Enter key:
Must be trigger on mouse click xor pressing Enter on the keyboard, not both.
When clicking on a button it gets focus and subsequent Enters trigger the
button. This keypresses could be accidental or not, for example when pressing
enter multiple times to accept a popup/alert window because lots of people
still press Enter many times as a way to ensure the system gets the input.

Simple and double click must be the same:
Never differentiate simple and double click, both must trigger the same action.
Still too many people confuses HTML and the very well known Microsoft Windows 
desktop icons, the first just needs a simple click but on the seconds it is
used to select an item without doing any action.
